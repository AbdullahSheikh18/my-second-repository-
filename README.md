# Car Classification Using Teachable Machine

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify various types of cars using image recognition. By leveraging Google’s Teachable Machine, users can train and deploy their own models with ease.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Identify different types of cars (e.g., sedans, SUVs, trucks).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and upload images for training and testing.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Classify new car images instantly after training.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser to access Teachable Machine.
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts (optional).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cars-classified.git
   cd cars-classified
   ```

2. **Data Collection**
   - Gather images of various car types. Aim for at least 50 images per category for better training results.

3. **Train the Model**
   - Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
   - Select the "Image Project" option and upload your car images.
   - Train the model by following the on-screen instructions.

4. **Testing**
   - Once trained, test the model with new images to evaluate its performance.

5. **Deployment**
   - Use the provided HTML file to create a simple web application for users to upload images for classification.

## Enhancements

- Consider expanding the dataset to include more car types for improved accuracy.
- Implement additional features like API integration to fetch car specifications based on classification results.
- Explore mobile compatibility for on-the-go classification.
